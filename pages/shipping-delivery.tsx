        <p className="text-sm leading-7 text-zinc-700">
          Customs can often charge duty on imports into certain countries. We
          have no control over this and cannot be held responsible for any
          import taxes/duties that may be charged. These taxes go to the
          government of the country that you are importing the goods. You will
          be liable for any charges incurred due to import taxes. It is illegal
          to undervalue/mark as a gift any parcel to avoid paying duty, so
          please donâ€™t ask us to do this, as any requests will be ignored.
